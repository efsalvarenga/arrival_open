## Easteros

### The Kathan Empire

In the vast desert of Easteros lies Katho, an empire built on the ruins of a long-forgotten civilisation. The people of the empire are hardy and resourceful, able to survive in the harsh conditions of the desert through their ingenuity and determination. The rulers of the empire are shrouded in mystery, and their true identities are known only to a select few. Some say that they are descendants of the ancient civilisation upon which the empire was built, while others believe that they are immortal beings who have existed since the dawn of time. Regardless of their true origins, the rulers of the empire are feared and revered by their subjects, who see them as both protectors and oppressors. 

Katho's lands in the sourth have always been coveted by the aberrations and frozen monstrosities of the D'elsinese Empire. The war between the two kingdoms has lasted for centuries, with neither side gaining a clear military advantage. The current rulers of Katho have already committed most of their available armies to the war, and the empire is now anguished. Military alliances have been in talks for the last ten years. Neighbouring lands such as Foucheresia (to the west), and their fierce dragonborn host, and Romburghia (to the east) have pledged support.

As the war persist, people of the desert empire have grown weary of the conflict. Some in the north are questioning the motives of their rulers and their willingness to sacrifice so many lives for the sake of power and control. Whispers of rebellion and unrest are growing louder in the capital in the north, Throtha. Meanwhile, the entire northern region has been battling their own problems, including the spree of Lady Scurvy and the [Faletism](religions.md#Faletism) religious takeover.

Near the southern border, in the provinces where this enduring conflict has ravaged for centuries, entire lifetimes have been spent amidst the horrors, with generations being born and dying within its vicious cycle. Cities have become twisted and warped by the darkness that permeates their every corner. Many settlements have even adopted human sacrifice rituals and even cannibalism. Some of the ancient ruins have been repurposed, with dark and sinister magic used to reshape them into towering fortresses and twisted citadels. Those who venture and live too close to the conflict risk being dragged down into the depths of its desolate nightmares, long forgetting what life in Katho was like before.

#### Linhe County

All this cities (except Gimorkoc, which still follows the [Yotunn Ancestors](religions.md#Yotunn%20Ancestors) religion) have been over the decades converting to the northern religion known as [Faletism](religions.md#Faletism). You are also told the northern cities do not speak the same common language as you do. The common language you've been speaking until now on the region is called Cold Nulfirther. In the northern cities they speak a dialect of this language called Sun Nulfirther, and also the official Khathan language. The Dust elves will speak all of these.

#### Dust Desert (Nargun Captaincy)

Home of the Dust Elves, exceptional traders that live a nomadic life in the desert north of the Glasrath mountains. They believe in nature gods and are generally trustworthy.

### Romburghia

Romburghia is a troubled land, rife with tension, secrets and fear. Its people are divided by culture and religion, and its aristocracy is on the brink of collapse. A coastal kingdom, located on the east of Easteros, Romburghia is bordered by the Khathan Empire to the west. It is also the only land access of Hincland to the continent, making it a strategically important location. At the heart of Romburghia's power struggles lies a fragmented aristocratic organisation, where no one is sure of their own power. The titular ruler, surrounded by a web of spying and blackmail, is feared by all who cross their path. Meanwhile, the ruler's lover and the court sorcerer hold strong position and influence, using their power to manipulate the court's fragile balance.

The kingdom is a patchwork of cultures, with the north being dominated by the ancient Mercian ways, while the south is a vast expanse of nomadic Nurfirth. However, the original Mercian religion has long been in decline, with most of the country now following either the church of Falet or the gods of the [Yotunn Ancestors](religions.md#Yotunn%20Ancestors) pantheon. The [Faletism](religions.md#Faletism) religion has officially been adopted by the kingdom, but it is a decision made out of fear, for the Mercians of Hincland have long been rumored to dabble in black magic. The rulers have turned a blind eye to non-conventional approaches to converting folk religion followers to the official religion of Falet, desperately seeking to expand its reach and hold over the kingdom.


### Kiranu


### Naragzah Dwarven Empire

#### Tolfonddund Dwarves

The southern mine system on the Glasrath Mountains was created by dwarves coming from the town of Tolfoddund, two centuries ago (3671 NC). These dwarves were not as advanced as the Nargun dwarves, but made enough wealth by trading dwarven goods with Watheton (especially Yeswite), which then traded them to other peoples of the Kuzar County and, more broadly, with the Khathan empire.

#### Nargun Dwarves

The Nargun was a strong Dwarven empire founded in 3217 NC.

The King was killed about 15 years ago, in an attack that came from the Ammuinoth, alongside his son and heir. Sitmeak Greybow, was then appointed as regent and has been the regent since - he is in charge. The brother, Whursock Greybow, is the commander of the army.

### The Ammuinoth, the Ghost Domain and the Ophaire

#### The Ammuinoth

The kingdom of Iopothae was a very advanced kingdom from ancient times. It is said it covered a larger region than the current [The Kathan Empire](realms.md#The%20Kathan%20Empire). One of the features of the kingdom of Iopothae was the creation of the Ammuinoth (starting around year 1000 IT), a subterranean superstructure that traversed the kingdom (SW to NE), following what is known as the Brezal Paths. These paths are believed to carry intensified earth energy. Some researchers believe the energy paths are not real, and that the construction, in a leaf shape, was in deference to the old nature gods. In the Ammuinoth tunnels, castles, shrines and temples were built, as presents to the old gods.

The Ammuinoth was built by an alliance of immortal elves and dwarves for over a thousand years, which was responsible for shaping the races of the drow (dark elves) and the duergar (dark dwarves), as they ventured deeper and deeper over centuries. It is believed that the drow and duergar came into contact with some subterranean evil power, and were corrupted by it. But the corruption went unnoticed, until it was too late. It is not known when exactly, but around two millennia after the construction started the drow came across a god-built cavern system below the Ammuinoth. This was named the Ghost Domain (or the Underdark by the nowadays drows). The duergar did not venture often to the Ghost Domain, as it was too primitive for them.

The Ammuinoth was built as a series of underground tunnels following what is known as the Brezal Paths. These paths are believed to carry intensified earth energy. In these tunnels, castles, shrines and temples were built, as presents to the old gods. Now, thousands of years later, some of these temples are in ruins and some of the tunnels have also collapsed. On the map, in blue are Brezal Paths whose tunnels have collapsed or partially collapsed and in black are tunnels in work order.

Nowadays, thousands of years later, some of these temples are in ruins and some of the tunnels have also collapsed. Even the better tunnels have several fractures, from where the Ghost Domain can be accessed. In every large construction in the Ammuinoth, access to the surface and the ghost domain were built - but some of them are now lost.

**Dwellers of the Ammuinoth**:
- Due to the access from the surface to the Ammuinoth: gangs of bandits and other scourge take lair and hide in the tunnels, in general everyone who wants to hide from society can be found there.
- Due to the frequent connects with the Ghost Domain: most of the creatures from the ghost domain can be found here including fiends, undead, drows, duegar, even beholders!

#### The Ghost Domain and the Ophaire

The Ghost Domain is grouped in layers: the Upper Domain (also known as Upperdark), the Lower Domain (also known as Middledark) and the Ophaire (also known as the Lowerdark, or the Dark Primitive). In the region where there is the Ammuinoth, it connects the surface to the Upper Domain, but it is also possible to go directly from the Upper Domain to the surface, although in very challenging cavern openings, mostly inaccessible for human sized creatures. As time went by, the drow and duergar grew apart: the duergar living in the Ammuinoth and in the north east area of the Upper Domain, while the drow lived in more deep areas of the Ghost Domain, mostly towards the south.

The Ghost Domain's underground landscape varies from small subterranean fissures almost impossible for adventurers to crawl through, to wide expanses of deep water that hides coral caves, hollowed out sections of ice in which creatures lived, and places where fungus, bones, or even pure force formed caves. This varied landscape is as dynamic as the surface. Some areas are always changing over time because of underground magma rivers or the emptying of underground lakes due to cracks in the rock formed by earthquakes. This meant maps of the Underdark were highly unreliable.

The Upper Domain is about 4 Km deep, and it is inhabited by many dark-loving creatures (not necessarily evil ones). Some drow also live here, and sometimes some duergar too. The Lower Domain, 5 to 15 Km deep, is where the biggest drow cities exist, and drow nobility lives there. These drow are already too disconnected from the world above, and even duergar fear their evilness. Finally, deeper lies the Ophaire. It is not fully known if the dark primitive is still part of the world as a cavern system or if it is already some other type of dimension, as time and space seem to flow differently in such a depth. It is said the dark primitive lies between 20 and 100 Km from the surface, but these are all speculations. The deepest areas of the Ophaire are also known as Shadowfell, and in these regions it is said that only true evil and madness can live.
