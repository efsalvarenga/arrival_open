# The Biomes and Climate of Guemenos

## Jade Wasteland 

Most of the region south of the Glasrath mountain chain is a cold desert, called the Jade Wasteland. Average yearly temperatures are mostly around 0C, but it gets much colder at night. The average is also much lowered closer to the mountains (-11C and below). It is a bit warmer in the coastal areas (2C), where one finds taiga and cold forests.

## Desolate Flats

The desert region north of the Glasrath mountain chain is warmer than the Jade Wasteland, but still particularly cold.
