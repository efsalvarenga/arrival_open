# The History of Guemenos
***As told in the region of Maqqatba of the Latter Earth***

## TLDR

**Weavers and Angels**
- Nek created the world (Guemenos) and the tapestry of its reality (Theurgy)
- Life emerged from this tapestry, including an ethereal race known as the Weavers, who could weave the reality itself
- Over millennia, empires and kingdoms emerged, and wars amongst them were common
- The Weavers decided to consult with Nek, so they would stop the wars and violence in Guemenos
- Instead of being received by Nek, the Weavers were received by Nek's Angels, which enraged the Weavers
- The Weavers decided to further expand their powers, through the creation of Theotechnical engines
- Meanwhile, the Angels were also infuriated as Nek gave lesser creatures a beautiful world such as Guemenos
- For eons, the Angels and the Weavers fought, culminating with the Angels winning and pushing the Weavers to the depths of Guemenos

**The Edrahil and The Kyri**
- The Angels then took Guemenos for themselves and, over the centuries, while most of them waned in power and became mortal races, some became powerful and proclaimed themselves as **The Edraihil**
- Meanwhile, the Weavers and their peoples lived in the underworld, and through their Theotechnical engines they created the constructed gods, which became known as **The Kyri**
- The Kyri were then awoken and declared war and defeated the Edraihil, banishing most of them from Guemenos
- Guemenos now live in a unstable balance with the remaining Edrahil constantly challenged by the much stronger Kyri
- The Angels and the Weavers are long gone, what is left is their waned races, cross-bred over thousands of years.

## The Creation

In the darkness of a forgotten universe, the world of Guemenos was born from the hand of Nek, a deity who crafted its very foundations. With its inception, Nek gifted the realm with an intricate tapestry of energy known as Theurgy, an otherworldly power that pulsed through the fabric of existence.

Intriguingly, the powers of Theurgy took on a life of their own, self-organising and imbuing Guemenos with life, birthing an array of creatures that spanned its domains. Among these enigmatic beings were the Weavers, ethereal races forged from the very essence of Theurgy itself. They embodied the raw potential of this arcane energy, possessing a mastery that surpassed mortal comprehension.

Over the course of centuries, the Weavers delved into the mysteries of Theurgy, researching deeper into its enigmatic depths. Through their relentless work, they unlocked the secrets of Theotechnical engines, wondrous devices that harnessed and channeled the boundless power of Theurgy. With each invention, Guemenos flourished, and its inhabitants revelled in the marvels that these devices wrought.

## Of Weavers and Angels

As is often the way with great power, discord brewed amidst the Weavers. Their divergent beliefs clashed, and the realm was consumed by the ravages of imperial wars that scarred the land for ages untold. Seeking resolution, the Weavers convened in a grand council, their intentions set upon parlaying with the enigmatic Nek himself, hoping to find a common ground and end the strife that plagued their world.

In their anticipation, the Weavers ventured to Nek's halls, expecting to encounter the deity himself. To their dismay, they were instead greeted by the ethereal presence of Angels, emissaries of Nek. Betrayal dripped from the air as the Weavers realised that Nek had shunned their entreaties, substituting his own celestial messengers in his stead.

Enraged by this apparent treachery, the Weavers vowed to rise above Nek and his celestial minions. They intensified their efforts, seeking to augment their Theotechnical engines to surpass the power of Nek and the Angels. Alas, their ambitions would be dashed against the shores of fate, for the Angels, envious of the world Nek had woven for the Weavers and lesser races, devised a plan to seize Guemenos for themselves.

Eons of bloodshed ensued as the Angels waged relentless war against the Weavers. The heavens trembled with their clash, and the inevitable came to passâ€”the Angels emerged victorious. They claimed Guemenos as their own, declaring themselves The Edraihil, the self-proclaimed sons and daughters of Nek.

Banished to the depths of the world they once called home, the Weavers and their peoples retreated, their powers simmering in the shadows. For millennia, their knowledge and strength melded in the crucible of isolation, ultimately culminating in the construction of the Kyri. This powerful forged pantheon stood as a testament to their tenacity, a bastion of power to reclaim what had been taken.

As the ages unfolded, most of the Edraihil gradually waned in power, their once celestial forms degraded into mere shadows of their former glory. Yet, a select few endured, ascending to blessed stature, their essence resonating with the divine. These remnants of the Edraihil persisted as powerful beings, revered and feared by those who dared cross their path. A chapter in the grand tapestry of Guemenos had closed, while another, steeped in dark intrigue and ancient grudges, unfurled in the depths below.

## The rule of the Edraihil

The Edrahil, their power solidified and their dominion unchallenged, reshaped Guemenos in the image of their celestial progenitor, Nek. With intricate incantations and unfathomable rituals, they twisted the very fabric of reality, moulding the land to reflect their desires. Mountains rose like jagged fangs, rivers twisted and turned in unnerving patterns, and forests whispered secrets that only the chosen few could decipher.

In their divine fervour, the Edrahil bestowed life upon new creatures, imbuing them with aspects that paid homage to their own divine essence. From the writhing depths of the oceans to the desolate expanse of the deserts, monstrous beings were a grotesque reflection of their creators, bearing distorted features and unearthly forms. These abominations roamed, forever serving as a testament to the Edrahil's power and their mastery over creation itself.

For millennia, Guemenos thrived under the rule of the three eldest Edrahil, each one presiding over a distinct realm within the twisted tapestry of the world. The land teemed with life, albeit with twisted accents, and the inhabitants lived in a delicate balance between awe and terror. The Edrahil were revered as gods, their presence feared and worshipped by the lesser beings who lived in the three realms.

But deep within the heart of Guemenos, a foreboding darkness stirred. The cosmic fabric that held this twisted realm together quivered with an otherworldly anticipation, whispering of a lurking menace that threatened to shatter the fragile equilibrium. Shadows loomed larger, madness dripped like poison from the air, and whispers of an ancient, eldritch force began to echo through the ethereal halls of Guemenos.

### Iopothae

The kingdom of Iopothae stood as a testament to the Edrahil's mastery, surpassing all others in its ingenuity and sophistication, a beacon of advanced knowledge and arcane arts. Towering spires of obsidian and basalt pierced the heavens, their blackened peaks scraping against the ethereal veil. Marble palaces, adorned with intricate carvings that whispered tales of forgotten gods, sprawled across the landscape, testifying to the might and ambition of the Iopothaeans. It was here that the first recorded calendar was meticulously crafted, its intricate markings etched upon ancient stones known as Chronoliths, unraveling the mysteries of time itself.

Chief among their astonishing creations was the [Ammuinoth](../realms.md#Ammuinoth), a colossal subterranean structure, its true purpose veiled in mystery. This titanic structure, comprised of intricate tunnels and temples, many hummed with a potent energy, drawing whispers of ancient powers that slumbered within its heart. It served as both a symbol of Iopothae's prowess and a reminder of the depths to which their hubris had driven them.

Little did they know that their relentless pursuit of supremacy would beckon forth forces from realms unseen, as dark entities stirred, their insidious tendrils creeping ever closer to the heart of Iopothae. In the realm of Iopothae, the seeds of their own downfall had been sown, and the price for their audacity would soon be demanded in full.
